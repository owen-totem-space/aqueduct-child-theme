## Nav Menu Notes
1. Parent menu items should be unclickable

    This is achieved by setting the link to the parent item as "#" and simply adding a label.

2. Parent Item Needs CSS Class

    This is achieved by clicking "screen options" in the top right, ticking the CSS classes option. Then add the following to the CSS class box of the menu item:

    * dropdown1
    * dropdown2
    * dropdown3

        Up to dropdown8

This is required to allow dropdown functionality of the sidemenu. It also brings the added benefit of removing users ability to mistakenly click the nav menu label and being brought to a dead/useless page.

## Recomended Actions
* Deactivate Avatars in Settings
    
    I have removed them from appearing in the forum. The stylesheet impacts page load speed (on every page) and they load an unnessary amount of images to pages they are on, impacting load speed again. Are they really necessary? do people actually use them?

* Fix 404 errors to images loaded on blogs

    These __significantly__ impact page load speed

* IMC Logos
